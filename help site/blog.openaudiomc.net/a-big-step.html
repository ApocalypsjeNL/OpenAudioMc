    <h1>Welcome to the new OpenAudioMc!</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>

    <h3>A little bit of back story</h3>
    <p>Ever since the initial release of OpenAudioMc in october of 2016, we've set the goal to make the best minecraft
        audio-system there is.
        <br/>There was a specific need for a project like this within a specific set of server communities. For the last
        few years OpenAudioMc has been the go-to audio solution for those with a themepark server and we where always
        aiming to provide everything to make experiences like those better and more immerse, while also working in the
        background and requiring little to no attention or effort from the user so they can focus on what matters.</p>

    <h3>A new era</h3>
    <p>Up until the release of 5.0, there was a constant focus to add new features and experiment with user
        feedback.<br/>Many features where added, a lot got removed and those that got left in got perfected in our 5.0
        series of builds to be the version you all love today.</p>
    <p>To expand the project and grow towards new communities we've partnered up with <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbyS9AQt6KE0XUuGqXya90A">popular Minecraft youtuber a6d</a> and lead
        of <a href="https://twitter.com/FallenUpdates">the Fallen server</a> to negotiate their vision of the ultimate
        platform for game servers. The concept was to make a voice chat solution where you can make group calls with
        teams or friend lists and immediately start talking, without the user having to make any accounts or downloading
        anything.<br/>
        A system like this would be perfect for gamemodes/minigames.</p>

    <p><b>Spoiler alert!</b> That's exactly what we did, and made it even more awesome than that!</p>

    <h2>What we've been working on</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The OpenAudioMc partner program</li>
        <li>Seamless cross-server support for large scale game networks.</li>
        <li>A new modern looking and feeling client to make navigation a lot easier for new users.</li>
        <li>A voice call solution without downloads or registration, just a one click link integrated in the OpenAudioMc
            web client.
        </li>
        <li>A notification system to share important in-game information.</li>
        <li>A new version of the plugin that supports other platforms than Spigot.</li>
        <li>A completely new backend service setup to allow for our rapid growth, even with this extra target
            audience.
        </li>
        <li>A scalable private hosting solution for OpenAudioMc Partners (docker based).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For current and new servers</h3>
    <p>We've set out to build the next generation of the OpenAudioMc software set to be future ready but not lose the
        functionality of our previous versions, keep everything backwards compatible and still feel trusted by our
        current users.</p>
    <p>This was such a success, that current users of OpenAudioMc can enjoy the new experience just by updating their
        plugin. All their settings, data and commands will work just like expected without any more work required. Same
        goes for new regular users, they can setup the plugin and use it just like everyone did before.</p>

    <h3>For networks</h3>
    <p>For networks is where it just starts to get interesting.<br/>They can now make use of our Bungeecord version to
        provide one client for their entire server.</p>

    <h2>Voice Chat</h2>
    <div class="line-small"></div>
    <p>Starting this launch, OpenAudioMc partners will have access to the Voice Chat feature for their community.</p>
    <p>With this, player's with permissions (or via a API integration) can create high quality and low latency group
        calls with up to 16 players.<br/>
        A voice chat is completely contained within the webclient and doesn't require any downloads or manual
        registration or linking by the player, all they have to do is open the webclient (via a command in game that'll
        provide them with a unique URL) and keep the tab open in the background, just like any other OpenAudioMc
        session.</p>

    <p>But yeah, that's right. Voice Chat (currently) only is available for partners. Although we do have plans to make it available for public use in the near future, our current server capacity won't hold up. Since OpenAudioMc is a free service we cant just upgrade our servers or add new ones to the pool, that budget would have to come from somewhere, but as of yet we're not sure how.</p>
    <p>Listed below are some fancy screenshots with a small video demoing this feature.
        <br/>To learn more, please read about our new Partner Program below.</p>

    <h2>Partner Program</h2>
    <div class="line-small"></div>
    <p>Also new starting this launch is the OpenAudioMc Partner Program.</p>

        <li>Dedicated Voice Chat servers</li>

        <i><u>
            <small>(please note that these partnerships are not for everyone and only intended for bigger servers who
                have specific questions or requests to implement OpenAudioMc on the larger scale. Failing to meet the
                requirements will simply get you denied, or no response at all)
