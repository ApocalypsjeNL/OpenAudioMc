# Blocked domain
### The domain you have configured for your web-client seems to be banned after manual review. Please check [the rules](https://github.com/Mindgamesnl/OpenAudioMc/blob/master/LICENCE_and_PRIVACY.md) and revert to the default client at `https://client.openaudiomc.net/` or contact us through the discord to appeal.
*Note about appealing: please don't come with any useless excuses about why you did what you did. Own up to it, explain why, and we'll think about lifting the domain ban.*
