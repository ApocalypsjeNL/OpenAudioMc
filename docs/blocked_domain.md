# Banned OpenAudioMc account
Your account has been banned/blocked from OpenAudioMc's services for violating the [Rules and Terms](https://github.com/Mindgamesnl/OpenAudioMc/blob/master/LICENCE_and_PRIVACY.md). You may not open the client or change settings in OpenAudioMc-Plus while your account is in this state. 
You can contact me in [Discord](https://discord.openaudiomc.net/) to explain your case, reasoning and possibly appeal your ban.  

*Note about appealing: please don't come with any useless excuses about why you did what you did. Own up to it, explain why, and we'll think about lifting the domain ban.*
