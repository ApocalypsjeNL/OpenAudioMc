Speakers are little blocks you can place in your Minecraft world. Just like real speakers in a themapark, all of them play synchronized and can be hidden. The thing that makes them special is that they share some properties just like real audio sources, You can't hear them from too far away, and the volume depends on your location relative to a speaker.

There's only one command that gives you the speaker, after executing you will receive a Speaker in your inventory. You can place it via the creative mode. To remove them, you just go up to one and destroy the block like normal, this can also only be done when you are in the creative mode.

New in 6.0.3, you can also set an optional range for a speaker (measured in blocks)

The command follows the following format:
```
/openaudio speaker <source> [radius]
```

Example, to receive a speaker playing the park entrance sound, you should do
```
/openaudio speaker https://soundcloud.com/mrfijiwiji/imalright 10
```
To change the spaker radius, you can also right-click on a speaker. A GUI will open where you can select a new radius.
