Installation couldn't be simpler
1. Download the most recent jar from https://openaudiomc.net/
2. Place the jar inside the `plugins` directory of your server
3. Restart your server
4. Enjoy

Important notes:
 - Be sre to also install the plugin in your bungeecord (if you have one). You might need to give yourself the 'openaudiomc.*' permission in your bungeecord.
 - Be sure to use Spigot or one of the many forks, we do not support craft bukkit.
 - Some (free) minecraft hosting providers block OpenAudioMc from functioning, despite offering a copy of the plugin (looking at you, MineHut)
