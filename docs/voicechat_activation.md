# Claimed Invite Activation
Hurray! Welcome to the OpenAudioMc public voice chat beta!

#### Rules and Notes
- Be prepared to test. Voice chat is still in development, so you have to share feedback (negative and positive) and link to issues you may encounter
- Uptime isn't as good as it will be, voice connections die off once a day for production updates due to backend changes and updates.
- Don't use this on a production server. Voicechat still has some work ahead, and these codes are only usable for 10 slots.
- These licenses won't be valid forever, they will get revoked when vc goes public.
- Don't use your own hosted client, for the time being, you'll want the continuous patches and improvements.
- It doesn't have any moderation other than supporting litebans mutes for now
- It's really best used on your survival server with a few friends, why not use it as an excuse to get together and have some fun
- Please just actually use it
- Have fun, and let me know if you like it :)
